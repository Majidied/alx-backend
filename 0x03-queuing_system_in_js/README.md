# 0x03. Queuing System in JavaScript

This directory contains projects and tasks related to implementing a queuing system using JavaScript. The aim is to understand and work with queue data structures and their applications in backend systems, particularly in managing and processing tasks asynchronously.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Understand the concepts of queues and their applications.
- Implement a basic queuing system in JavaScript.
- Use libraries and tools to manage queues.
- Handle task processing asynchronously.
- Work with various queuing systems like Redis.
- Integrate a queuing system with a backend server.

## Project Tasks

### 0. Basic Queue
Implement a basic queue class in JavaScript.

### 1. Queue with Callback
Extend the basic queue to handle tasks with callbacks for processing.

### 2. Redis Queue
Implement a queue using Redis to manage and persist tasks.

### 3. Job Processing
Create a job processing system using the queue, ensuring tasks are processed asynchronously.

### 4. Advanced Queue Management
Implement features for managing and monitoring the queue, such as job retries, delays, and failures.

### 5. Integration with Backend
Integrate the queuing system with a backend server to handle real-time task processing.
